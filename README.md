## About Myself
#### Basic Data

Name : <b> Amr Ahmed Taher Mohamed </b> <br>
Email : <b> amrtaher1995@gmail.com </b> <br>
University : <b> Ain Shams University </b> : http://www.asu.edu.eg/ <br>
Year : Fourth year in Computer Science Departement <br>

<br><br>

#### Personal Projects
My personal projects are mostly around graphical scenes/games/android and some university projects <br>
here is a list of some of the projects i created :
1. An openGL c++ project that is made to visualize our solar system with some features like adding dynamic moons, you can find the link <br>
for a project run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSYD7hUOuoc&t=2s">here</a>.
2. A project made with p5.js (a processing library used for graphics), it is a game in which a player is asked to solve some mcq programming questions <br> and then he plays a game at the end by which he is against spaceships that are trying to destroy him.<br>
The user will have a score that will be compared with other user's scores which is all stored in a firebase database. <br>
Test the game [here](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/TanksAlgo)
3. A simple Android ap10plication to keep track of people's points in a community that i work in, the project is connected into a firebase database <br> and contains authentication methods to not allow normal users to update other people's points.

## The Plan
Chapters to be implemented <br>
1. Chapter 3, Solving problems by searching
2. Chapter 18, Learning from examples
3. Chapter 16, Making simple decisions
4. Chapter 22 , Natural Language Processing
<br>
Before digging into the time plan details or how the communication shall be made i'd like to mention why i picked these chapters.<br>
Some of the chapters mentioned are already implemented like Solving problmes by searching, what i aim to do is to enhance the visual 
graphics of how these algorithms are demonstrated to the user, like for example the A* algorithm, i'd use a javascript framework called 
 [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create a better scene of nodes that the user can interact with them and they would animate when clicked.<br>
The whole enhancements and addition of new algorithms would be built by p5.js (a framework for graphics), such framework provides lots of tools.<br>
Chapters like Learning from examples or NLP are considered to be a very interesting fields for me as i learned some of the fundemntals of Machine Learning / Deep Learning and my graduation is built upon such fields (A classifier to classify executable files to be Malware or not based on their API sequence, we are using a recurrent neural network).<br>
 
### Plan Time
1. Week 1-3 I will learn more about the algorithms i'm going to implement from the book/ other sources
2. Week 3-5 Implementing Algorithms in chapter 3 and enhancing their graphical looks
3. Week 5-6 Revising on the implemented algorithms with my mentor to enhance it or correct any errors
4. Week 6-8 Implementing Algorithms in Chapter 18 and enhancing Chapter 22 algorithms
5. Week 8-9 Revising Algorithms implemented in the previous 2 weeks with my mentor and enhancing them
6. Week 9-11 Implementing Chapter 16 Algorithms and revising them 
7. 11-12 Wrapping up my work with my mentor

<br>
 I strongly believe that this plan would work cause of these reasons:
1.  his is my final semester in University and i will be completely free to work after that
2. I love creating graphical scenes esepcially with p5.js, i think i will be able to learn the algorithms i don't know quickly and apply my ideas right away
3. p5.js is a framework that works on html pages by defining a canvas just like html5, it is pretty easy to replace some of the implemented components by better graphical ones with p5.js
4. I studied Software Engineering and i believe i have good knowledge on how to divide time according to given tasks.


#### How To Work Together 
First of all working with Github is mandatory, i have some experience working on open source projects within a community that i participate in called [OSC](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community), i'm one of the Owners right now and i manage some of the repositories over there. <br>
I'd like our communication to be made fully on Github and applications like Slack so we can discuss tasks or plans on designs of specific algorithms <br>
Finally these are some points to mention:
1. I prefer having a meeting with a mentor twice per week to revise and monitor the work i'm doing
2. If there is a vacation or a familay holiday it will be maximum 3-4 days and i would continue working over but meetings will be held when i'm back 
3. If possible i prefer using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) for screen sharing or voice calling meetings.
