#### Personal Projects
My personal projects are mostly around graphical scenes/games/android and some university projects <br>
here is a list of some of the projects i created :
1. An openGL c++ project that is made to visualize our solar system with some features like adding dynamic moons, you can find the link <br>
for a project run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSYD7hUOuoc&t=2s">here</a>.
2. A project made with p5.js (a processing library used for graphics), it is a game in which a player is asked to solve some mcq programming questions <br> and then he plays a game at the end by which he is against spaceships that are trying to destroy him.<br>
The user will have a score that will be compared with other user's scores which is all stored in a firebase database. <br>
Test the game [here](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/TanksAlgo)
3. A simple Android ap10plication to keep track of people's points in a community that i work in, the project is connected into a firebase database <br> and contains authentication methods to not allow normal users to update other people's points.

## The Plan
Chapters to be implemented <br>
1. Chapter 3, Solving problems by searching
2. Chapter 18, Learning from examples
3. Chapter 16, Making simple decisions
4. Chapter 22 , Natural Language Processing
<br>
Before digging into the time plan details or how the communication shall be made i'd like to mention why i picked these chapters.<br>
Some of the chapters mentioned are already implemented like Solving problmes by searching, what i aim to do is to enhance the visual 
graphics of how these algorithms are demonstrated to the user, like for example the A* algorithm, i'd use a javascript framework called 
[p5.js](https://www.p5js.org/) to create a better scene of nodes that the user can interact with them and they would animate when clicked.<br>
The whole enhancements and addition of new algorithms would be built by p5.js (a framework for graphics), such framework provides lots of tools.<br>
Chapters like Learning from examples or NLP are considered to be a very interesting fields for me as i learned some of the fundemntals of Machine Learning / Deep Learning and my graduation is built upon such fields (A classifier to classify executable files to be Malware or not based on their API sequence, we are using a recurrent neural network).<br>
 
### Plan Time
1. Week 1-3 I will learn more about the algorithms i'm going to implement from the book/ other sources
2. Week 3-5 Implementing Algorithms in chapter 3 and enhancing their graphical looks
3. Week 5-6 Revising on the implemented algorithms with my mentor to enhance it or correct any errors
4. Week 6-8 Implementing Algorithms in Chapter 18 and enhancing Chapter 22 algorithms
5. Week 8-9 Revising Algorithms implemented in the previous 2 weeks with my mentor and enhancing them
6. Week 9-11 Implementing Chapter 16 Algorithms and revising them 
7. 11-12 Wrap up my work with my mentor and publish it (will discuss how i should add it to the main website)



#### How To Work Together 
First of all working with Github is mandatory, i have some experience working on open source projects within a community that i participate <br>in called [OSC](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community), i'm one of the Owners right now and i manage some of the repositories over there. <br>
I'd like our communication to be made fully on Github and applications like Slack so we can discuss tasks or plans on designs of specific algorithms <br>
I'd also want to work within a given time plan that i will demonstrate in the upcoming parts, we could create weekly meet ups to review the progress of my work on the given tasks that are associated with my work and also previews to audit my work as time passes in order <br> to give comments about it when possible.
