#### Personal Projects
My personal projects are mostly around graphical scenes/games/android and some university projects <br>
here is a list of some of the projects i created :
1. An openGL c++ project that is made to visualize our solar system with some features like adding dynamic moons, you can find the link <br>
for a project run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSYD7hUOuoc&t=2s">here</a>.
2. A project made with p5.js (a processing library used for graphics), it is a game in which a player is asked to solve some mcq programming questions <br> and then he plays a game at the end by which he is against spaceships that are trying to destroy him.<br>
The user will have a score that will be compared by other user's scores which is all stored in a firebase database. <br>
Test the game [here](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/TanksAlgo)
3. A simple Android application to keep track of people's points in a community that i work in, the project is connected into a firebase database <br> and contains authentication methods to not allow normal users to update other people's points.

#### How To Work Together 
First of all working with Github is mandatory, i have some experience working on open source projects within a community that i participate <br>in called [OSC] (https://github.com/Open-Source-Community), i'm one of the Owners right now and i manage some of the repositories over there. <br>
I'd like our communication to be made fully on Github and applications like Slack so we can discuss tasks or plans on designs of specific algorithms <br>
I'd also want to work within a given time plan that i will demonstrate in the upcoming parts, we could create weekly meet ups to review the progress of my work on the given tasks that are associated with my work and also previews to audit my work as time passes in order <br> to give comments about it when possible.
