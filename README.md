#### Personal Projects
My personal projects are mostly around graphical scenes/games/android and some university projects <br>
here is a list of some of the projects i created :
1. An openGL c++ project that is made to visualize our solar system with some features like adding dynamic moons, you can find the link <br>
for a project run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSYD7hUOuoc&t=2s">here</a>.
2. A project made with p5.js (a processing library used for graphics), it is a game in which a player is asked to solve some mcq programming questions <br> and then he plays a game at the end by which he is against spaceships that are trying to destroy him.<br>
The user will have a score that will be compared by other user's scores which is all stored in a firebase database. <br>
Test the game [here](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/TanksAlgo)
3. A simple Android application to keep track of people's points in a community that i work in, the project is connected into a firebase database <br> and contains authentication methods to not allow normal users to update other people's points.
